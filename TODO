TODO:

- Comment code
- Update GitHub site
- Combine subclause refs and subclause AST node labels into a SubClause class

- Replacing OneOrMore with right-recursive form, for efficiency:
  - X_tail <- X X_tail? == X (X_tail / ())
  - OneOrMore:  X+ => X X_tail
  - ZeroOrMore: X* => X_tail?
  P <- X+  =>  P <- X (P / ());
  P <- X*  =>  P <- (X (P / ())) / ();
  

- precedence climbing becomes precedence descent, for bottom-up parsing 
- Longest can be used in lex rules to avoid prefix matches
